# Isaac Sim integration boundary

- **Document status:** Active implementation reference
- **Audience:** Runtime and simulation contributors
- **Authority:** Software-test guidance only; this integration grants no
  hardware, motion, contact, or release authority.

This directory documents the optional NVIDIA Isaac Sim runner. Executable,
packaged contracts live in
`software/src/rocell/integrations/isaac_sim/`; versioned JSON schemas live in
`software/schemas/`.

The current WP0 implementation provides:

- canonical v1 request and receipt envelopes;
- exact-field, unit, frame, joint-order, timing, digest, and zero-authority
  validation;
- a hardware-free fake adapter for lifecycle and evidence tests;
- a fail-closed external toolchain lock; and
- compact valid and invalid fixtures.

It does **not** import Isaac Sim, load a USD scene, use a GPU, run physics, or
produce clearance/contact evidence. A fake-adapter `PASS` has evidence class
`CONTRACT_TEST_ONLY` and expressly establishes only contract behavior.

## Windows runner candidate installed 2026-09-29

The designated host now has a dedicated `C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0` environment
containing CPython 3.12, `torch==2.11.0+cu130`, and
`isaacsim[all,extscache]==6.1.0.0`. Torch enumerates both installed NVIDIA
GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. The compact
[`host probe`](evidence/windows_dual_rtx3090_candidate_20260929.json) binds 26
Isaac/Torch distributions through their installed `METADATA` and `RECORD`
hashes and records zero hardware writes and zero physical movements.

This is a blocked candidate, not a selected runner. Isaac Sim has not been
launched, no NVIDIA terms were accepted by automation, and the settings
profile remains unavailable. NVIDIA documents driver 595.97 as tested for
Isaac Sim 6.1.0 on Windows; the host currently reports 591.86. The RTX 3090 is
also outside NVIDIA's documented minimum GPU set for 6.1.0 even though each
card has 24 GiB VRAM and RT capability. Compatibility must therefore be
measured after a reviewed driver and license decision.

The exact package installation commands were:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0
C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install torch==2.11.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install "isaacsim[all,extscache]==6.1.0.0" --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

Reproduce the non-launching probe from the repository root:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path 'software/src').Path
C:\IsaacSim\env_6_1_0\Scripts\python.exe -m rocell.integrations.isaac_sim.host_probe `
  --output software/integrations/isaac_sim/evidence/windows_dual_rtx3090_candidate_20260929.json
```

The probe imports neither Isaac Sim nor Torch. It cannot accept a license,
start a simulator, open robot transport, or generate wire commands.

## Verify WP0

From `software/`:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_isaac_sim_contracts.py -q
```

From the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/ci/check_docs.py
```

## Select the external runner

The committed
[`isaac_sim_toolchain_lock.json`](../../config/isaac_sim_toolchain_lock.json)
is deliberately `UNSELECTED`. Do not replace its null fields with guessed
values. On the designated compute runner:

1. install or pull one exact Isaac Sim release using an NVIDIA-supported path;
2. retain the exact installer/container identity and calculate its SHA-256;
3. export the enabled extension set and settings profile as canonical files;
4. hash both files;
5. record the runner platform and deterministic launch method;
6. review the exact selected version's license terms for the intended internal
   integration; and
7. change `selection_status` to `SELECTED` only in the same reviewed change
   that supplies all required identities.

`IsaacSimToolchainLock.load(...)` rejects the repository placeholder, partial
selections, unreviewed licensing, invalid digests, added fields, or any attempt
to add hardware authority.

## Next implementation boundary

The real adapter may begin only after the exact lock is selected. Its first
operation is asset import and kinematic parity (WP1), not trajectory execution:

1. start the locked application in standalone/headless mode;
2. confirm the live version and enabled extensions against the lock;
3. import the governed RoArm-M3 source;
4. emit the complete joint/link/axis/unit mapping report;
5. run the fixed FK parity corpus; and
6. stop without creating controller commands or hardware access.

work packages, acceptance gates, ownership, evidence, and limitations.
